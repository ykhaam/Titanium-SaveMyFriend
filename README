Welcome to your Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project

This is a blank project.  Start by editing your application's app.js to 
make your first mobile project using Titanium.

## Motive for development
	- Disaster messages can't be sent to all of the citizens due to physical and technical limitations.
	- If there are people who receive disaster message firstly, they can resend them to their friends and family by using SMS or Push Message.
	- Increase efficiency of 'sending disaster message' technique.

## Basis of development
	- Actually, all of GSM/CDMA communication did not work. VOIP based messenger properly worked during japaness earthquake(2011).
	- Most mobile companies provide 'free SMS service'. we used this service.

## Goal
	- Push and SMS send/receive
	- Parse and filter disaster message.
	- Load phone number registed in mobile device with App.
